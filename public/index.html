Intermediate students need to have at least completed AP CS Principles (or equivalent) and have done some coding outside of the classroom. They've sometimes also completed AP CS A. They should know functions, conditionals, loops, lists/2d-arrays."

There is individual attention where coaches are helping students learn important technical concepts, but a core part of the experience is collaborating with peers, just like what is expected in college, internships, and full-time jobs."
