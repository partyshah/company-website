            <p>
              After nearly a decade of teaching computer science, we saw a frustrating trend: students were obsessed with how things are built but gave little thought to what they were building. We watched talented students write impressive code—only for it to have no real impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a world where AI is rapidly automating the how, the true differentiator will be those who master the what. That's why we created <strong>Pike Teams</strong>—a high-intensity arena where the nation's top computer science students don't just code; they <strong>compete</strong> to build products that matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              For six weeks, our students work in elite teams, solving real problems in their communities with guidance from top industry experts. It's pressure-packed, it's fast, and it's the <strong>best</strong> way to learn.
