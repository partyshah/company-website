            <p>
            Hey I'm Kuai! I studied Computer Science at the University of Washington, earned a Math degree from Reed College, and pursued Financial Mathematics at NYU. I began my career as a software engineer at Google and later worked at leading hedge funds like Two Sigma and Citadel. Now, I'm the Director of Engineering at a startup in the Bay Area. I've always loved mentoring others in STEM â€” helping students land their first programming roles, guiding career transitions into software engineering, and mentoring engineers into leadership.
