            <p>
            Hey I'm Chris! I grew up in Connecticut and earned my Bachelor of Arts in Applied Math and Cognitive Neuroscience from Brown University in 2022. I recently completed my Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. At Brown, I conducted research on attentional control networks, exploring how attention is affected by rewards. Since graduating from Brown I have worked in business analytics at DraftKings while also deepening my knowledge of AI through my masterâ€™s coursework.
